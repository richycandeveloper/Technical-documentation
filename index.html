    <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>JavaScript and Java are two programming languages that play key roles in web development. While they share similar names, they serve different purposes and have distinct features.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a dynamic scripting language primarily used for client-side web development. It allows developers to add interactive elements, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and create dynamic content on web pages.</p>

    <p>Key features of JavaScript include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Client-side scripting</li>
      <li>Asynchronous programming with Promises and async/await</li>
      <li>Support for event-driven programming</li>
      <li>Wide usage in modern web development</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Java</h2>
    <p>Java, on the other hand, is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language. It is known for its platform independence, making it suitable for developing large-scale applications that can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>

    <p>Key features of Java include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Platform independence (Write Once, Run Anywhere)</li>
      <li>Object-oriented principles (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)</li>
      <li>Strong type system</li>
      <li>Extensive standard library</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While both JavaScript and Java are important in the world of programming, they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. JavaScript is essential for front-end web development, while Java is often used for back-end development and building enterprise-level applications.</p>

    <header>HTML and CSS</header>
   <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are essential technologies for creating and styling web content. They work together to structure and design web pages, providing the foundation for a visually appealing and well-organized user experience.</p>

    <h2>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h2>
    <p>HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages. It consists of a series of elements, each represented by tags, that define the content and the relationships between different parts of the page. HTML provides the backbone of a web document, organizing text, images, links, forms, and other elements into a hierarchical structure.</p>

    <p>Key features of HTML include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Document structure and semantics</li>
      <li>Hyperlinks and navigation</li>
      <li>Forms for user input</li>
      <li>Accessibility features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
    <p>CSS is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows developers to apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to enhance the visual appeal of a web page. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and defining how they should be displayed on the screen or other media.</p>

    <p>Key features of CSS include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Style rules and declarations</li>
      <li>Selectors for targeting HTML elements</li>
      <li>Box model for layout control</li>
      <li>Responsive design for different screen sizes</li>
    </ul>

   <header>Responsive Design</header>
    <p>Responsive design is an approach to web design that ensures a web page looks and functions well on various devices and screen sizes. With the increasing use of smartphones, tablets, and different-sized desktop monitors, it's crucial to create websites that adapt to different environments.</p>

    <h2>Key Principles of Responsive Design</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Fluid Grid Layout:</strong> Designing with relative units (like percentages) instead of fixed units (like pixels) allows content to flexibly adapt to different screen sizes.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Flexible Images:</strong> Use CSS properties like max-width to ensure images scale proportionally and don't overflow their containers on smaller screens.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Media Queries:</strong> Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on characteristics of the device, such as screen width, height, or device orientation.</p>

    <h2>Techniques for Responsive Design</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Mobile-First Design:</strong> Start designing for mobile devices first and then progressively enhance the layout for larger screens.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Viewport Meta Tag:</strong> Include the viewport meta tag in your HTML to control the viewport's width and scale on different devices.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Flexbox and Grid:</strong> Utilize CSS Flexbox and Grid layout systems to create flexible and responsive page structures.</p>

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Test on Multiple Devices:</strong> Ensure your website looks good and functions properly on various devices, browsers, and screen sizes.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Optimize images and resources to improve loading times, especially on slower network connections.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Progressive Enhancement:</strong> Build your design to work on all devices and progressively enhance the experience for devices with more capabilities.</p>

    <header>Media Queries</header>
     <header>Media Queries</header>
    <p>Media queries are a crucial component of responsive web design. They allow developers to apply different styles to a web page based on characteristics of the device, such as screen width, height, or device orientation. Media queries are commonly used in conjunction with CSS to create designs that adapt to various screen sizes and devices.</p>

    <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
    <p>The basic syntax of a media query looks like this:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
          /* Styles applied when the screen width is 600 pixels or less */
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Common Media Query Features</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Width and Height:</strong> Set styles based on the width or height of the viewport.</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
          /* Styles applied when the screen width is 768 pixels or less */
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>2. <strong>Orientation:</strong> Adjust styles based on the orientation of the device (portrait or landscape).</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        @media screen and (orientation: landscape) {
          /* Styles applied in landscape orientation */
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>3. <strong>Device Types:</strong> Apply styles based on the type of device, such as print or screen.</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        @media print {
          /* Styles applied when printing */
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Combining Multiple Conditions</h2>
    <p>Media queries can be combined to create more complex conditions. For example:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        @media screen and (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1200px) {
          /* Styles applied when the screen width is between 600 and 1200 pixels */
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
